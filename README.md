This project combined lease data from 2018 to 2024 with macroeconomic indicators to better understand and forecast U.S. office rents, both nationally and across major cities. Our initial models focused on understanding national rent trends. Ridge regression produced an in-sample R² of 61% but failed to generalize, with a negative test R² and a root mean squared error (RMSE) of 0.0012. The most influential macroeconomic drivers were inflation, GDP growth, and stock market returns, while volatility and business investment had dampening effects. A SARIMAX time-series model combining autoregressive components and macro factors provided more stable forecasts. It closely followed the post-2022 rent plateau and correctly anticipated the 2024 cooling. This model demonstrated that national rent exhibits inertia, and short-term macro changes only partly explain its movement.
The strongest performance came from a simple panel regression estimating rent sensitivity at the city (market) level. A fixed-effects specification with common slopes for all cities achieved an adjusted R² of 0.971 across 270 observations. This model confirmed that macro trends such as stock performance and inflation influence rent, but also showed wide variation across cities in average rent levels. Manhattan’s intercept exceeded $75/SF, while Salt Lake City and Phoenix were closer to $25/SF. Though GDP and stock market effects were generally positive, results for interest rates and volatility varied. The high explanatory power suggests that even a shared-coefficient model captures much of the variation in city-level rents.
Finally, we implemented a Bayesian hierarchical model to balance precision and uncertainty. This model allowed each city its own sensitivity to GDP and stock market returns, while using partial pooling to regularize extreme estimates. The results reinforced earlier findings: San Francisco and Manhattan had GDP sensitivities credibly below average, while Phoenix and Atlanta had above-average responsiveness. Stock returns had broadly positive effects across cities, with New York showing the strongest tie to financial markets.
Across modeling approaches, one consistent takeaway is that financial sentiment (captured through stock returns and market volatility) moves more quickly and directly into leasing activity than other indicators. GDP growth, while generally associated with rising rents, often impacts leasing decisions with a lag. In several cities, especially in the Sunbelt, rents rose sharply in tandem with market rallies and GDP rebounds. By contrast, in San Francisco and Manhattan, rents were uncorrelated, or even negatively correlated, with national GDP during the recovery period, likely reflecting local overhang from tech retrenchment and changing demand.
These insights suggest that when inflation rises in isolation, nominal rents may increase; but when inflation coincides with rising rates or volatility, demand can cool rapidly. As seen in our forecasts, rents responded slowly to deteriorating macro signals, affirming that leasing markets adjust gradually rather than instantly.
In sum, macro indicators help explain rent trends, but their predictive power improves significantly when paired with city-specific modeling and time-series structure. These findings support a two-tier strategy: national outlooks informed by macro shifts, and localized expectations based on city-level sensitivities. This framework would allow for more tailored forecasting, capital deployment, and risk assessment moving forward.
